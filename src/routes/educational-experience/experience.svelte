					<p>
						Leading a team of three, I created marketing strategy for a fictional apparel brans that 
						focused on implimenting sustainability practices throughout the entire product lifestyle. 
						To successfully create this business, I used IBISWorld and census reports to research 
						consumer and production data focused in India, Bangladesh, China, and the United States.

						<a href='https://cconboy0.wixsite.com/acknowledged' target='_blank'>company website</a>.
