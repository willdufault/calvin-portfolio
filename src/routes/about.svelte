					<p>
						My name is Calvin Conboy, and I am a current senior at the University of Massachusetts 
						Amherst, within the Isenberg School of Business. I am a candidate for a BBA in 
						marketing, along with a minor in economics.
					</p>
					<p>
						I've worked in a variety of business settings in a range of positions that have taught 
						me skills such as productive communication, effort based results, and multi-tasking. 
						Through a range of written and verbal communication experience, I've learned how to 
						communicate clearly and directly with customers and co-workers alike. With retail and 
						professional sales experience, I understand the value of hard work, and how to balance 
						a range of tasks simultaneously. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The extensive range of classes I have taken at two seperate highly accredited business 
						schools have taught me skills ranging from entrepreneurial business strategies, to 
						effective marketing skills. Through my education and prior work experience, I'll bring 
						energy, compassion, and insight to any task I am assigned.
