					<p>
						My name is Calvin Conboy, and I am a current senior at the
						University of Massachusetts Amherst, within the Isenberg School of
						Business. I am a candidate for a BBA in marketing, along with a minor
						in economics.
					</p>
					<p>
						Growing up under a small business owner, I have learnt the
						importance of hard work and the shown outcome that comes with
						dedication to every task I am working on. My passion for creativity
						shows through in every project I work on. With a strong belief in the
						power of effort-based outcomes, I strive to bring a unique and
						innovative approach to every project I'm assigned. My
						creativity-forward work approach has not only helped me in my past
						professional experience, but also in the success when leading projects
						within educational settings. 
					</p>
					<p>
						My passions outside of professional settings include attending live
						events, following the NBA, and spending time outside.
